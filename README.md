# omniva.lt "AliExpress" page remake


This project involves rewriting the "AliExpress" page to fit the structure and design of "omniva.lt". Rather than simply placing images on the page, responsive HTML code was created based on the existing images. The goal was to help with organic search, so that customers could find information about the service.
